Write a sketch that allows a user to access data in EEPROM using the serial monitor. In the serial monitor the user should be able to type one of two commands: “read” and “write. "Read" takes one argument, an EEPROM address. "Write" takes two arguments, an EEPROM address and a value.

For example, if the user types “read 3” then the contents of EEPROM address 3 should be printed to the serial monitor. If the user types “write 3 10” then the value 10 should be written into address 3 of the EEPROM

Paste a text version of your sketch (code) in the box below.





#include <EEPROM.h>
int address;
int data;
void setup() {
// put your setup code here, to run once:
Serial.begin(9600);
}


void loop() {
// put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
String buffer = "";
buffer = Serial.readString();
if(buffer.startsWith("read")){
address = buffer.substring(buffer.indexOf(' ')+1).toInt();
Serial.print(" to read from address: ");
Serial.print(address);
Serial.println();
Serial.println(EEPROM.read(address));
}
else if(buffer.startsWith("write")){
address = buffer.substring(6,7).toInt();
data = buffer.substring(8).toInt();
Serial.print(" to write: ");
Serial.print(data);
Serial.println();
Serial.print(" to address: ");
Serial.print(address);
Serial.println();
EEPROM.write(address, data);

}
}
